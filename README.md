require statement at the top of the PHP-File. You can see a example in the example.php file.

```PHP
//this is only used if you don't use composer
require __DIR__ . '/PATH_TO_LIB_FOLDER/MinecraftSkins.php';

use \MinecraftSkins\MinecraftSkins;

[...]

//load the skin from a file
$skinImage = imagecreatefrompng("cd6be915b261643fd13621ee4e99c9e541a551d80272687a3b56183b981fb9a.png");

//render the skin and make it 5 times bigger
$result = MinecraftSkins::skin($skinImage, 5);

//this part is for rendering the skin only
//tell the browser that we will send the raw image without HTML
header('Content-type: image/png');
imagepng($renderedSkin);
